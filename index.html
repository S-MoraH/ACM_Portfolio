                I recently graduated from Cal State University Los Angeles, with a major
                in Computer Science. I have been learning and developing software as
                part of my school, work, and hobby. I like challenging myself, trying 
                new things, as well as learning and experiencing new technologies to create
                cool stuff I wouldn't have before.

            I finished my degree and graduated from CSULA in 2023. Throughout my time
            there, I was fortunate to collaborate with many classmates and work on 
            classwork/projects together. I also learned many languages like Java, C, 
            JavaScript, JSON, and SQL. After my classes, I  dedicated my time to the 
            Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) club on campus. I worked on 
            many cool projects there, as seen in the experience tab. I could work on 
            cool projects through ACM, such as recreating Pacman and Tetris. Through 
            these projects, I learned how multi-layered project systems are created 
            and interact to create something like a video game. I also 
            learned about significant topics like OOP, inheritance, and software 
            design patterns in an real-world setting and the roles they play.
