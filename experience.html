            <p>                    - Attend biweekly workshops to study design patterns and programming
                      concepts. 
                    - Applied OOP and software design patterns of the pygame API
                    - Learned about machine learning and neural network AI systems.
                    - Utilized the NEAT algorithm to develop the AI Bird  
                    - Experienced working with and developing AI


                    During this project, I used Visual Studio Code, Pygame, NEAT 
                    Library, and Pickle Library. Using these tools, I recreated the 
                    game Flappy Birds and added an AI element that utilized the NEAT 
                    algorithm. It would generate birds that would get points for 
                    passing the tubes successfully and living longer or losing points 
                    for hitting a tube or dying early. A new generation would then be 
                    generated with the traits of the previous best-performing birds, 
                    eventually resulting in a perfect bird that plays the game 
                    flawlessly.

                - Learned about CSS and the interactions with HTML to 
                  decorate a website
                - Learned how to deploy a website using GitHub
                
            
                In this project, I used HTML and CSS to create a website. Over the 
                course of the workshop, ACM went over basic HTML and CSS components 
                as we put together our portfolios. After making a basic 
                structure/outline for the portfolios, I could fill in the info and 
                customize the site to my preference. Lastly, I used GitHub to deploy 
                it to the internet.

                - Learned about creating 2D games and game design
                - Utilized Unity's tile map function to create the game's world and

                This project was one of my first chances to experience a multi-file
                and multi-team project. It was developed using C# and Unity as its
                game engine. Using OOP principles, objects that pertained to Pacman 
                and the Ghosts that the players play against were created. I then 
                used these objects to determine their interactions and the game 
                loop. To make the world that the player sees, I used Unity's 
                tilemap system. In this system, one needs to place a piece at a 
                time to create an image, so I recreated a version of the Pacman 
                world using pre-textured pieces and drew it out in the engine.

                - Create movement by using and manipulating vectors
                - Utilized Unity's tile map function to procedurally create the 
                  game's world and visuals
                - Learned about creating 2D games and game design


                During this project, ACM re-created Tetris using Unity and C#. Unity 
                tilemaps were also used in this project, but only for the foreground.
                The background was an image, while the foreground was being drawn 
                procedurally. As the player's piece gradually falls or fills an 
                entire row to get points, the pieces on the board are redrawn and 
                updated. To have preset Tetrominoes as the game pieces, I used an 
                array of vectors that made up each Tetromino piece. Using these 
                arrays, I created the pieces of classic Tetris and can manipulate 
                its data to have it move along the board and rotate as the user 
                wants. Then, with some game logic to give points to the player for 
                filling up a row, I recreated Tetris.

                - Learned various aspects of the game function with an introduction 
                  to basic game design
                - Learned about class inheritance and software design patterns of 
                  the Forge API
                - Designed Textures and Animated a Single Model
                - Learning to utilize game development API for game modding.
                - Experiencing working with a fully fledged IDE.
                  
              
                For this project, I attended two different sessions of the Minecraft 
                mod. In the first one, I learned about the various aspects that make
                Minecraft work. Using the Minecraft and Minecraft forge API, I learned
                about existing classes. Then, through inheritance, I created subclasses
                that enabled me to develop custom armor and tools. In the second 
                session, ACM showed everything from the first session I attended and 
                as well as creating custom ore and blocks. Additionally, I learned 
                about generating the customs ore into the three Minecraft realms, like
                finding stone in the Overworld, netherrack in the Nether, or endstone 
                in the End. I also learned how to create custom food with the option 
                to give the players unique properties when consumed, like additional 
                haste or higher jumping power for a short duration. Finally, I 
                animated and created a monster mob model. This one was hostile like 
                the other entities players can spawn into the world with an egg. It 
                can wander around, avoid water, and attack the player, villager, or 
                creeper when they get close.

                - Created Animations using Unity's Animation system
                - Utilized Unity's scene management and multiple scenes to create levels for the game
                - Created movement using Unity's movement system and adding physics using Unity's Rigidbody component
                  
            
                During this project, I used C# and Unity to create a 2D platformer. For
                this project, the goal was to create a platformer with traps and levels.
                Using Unity's scene management, I made different scenes that 
                represented each of the layers in the game. To create the layers, I 
                used Unity's tilemap system and drew out the layers for each scene. I 
                utilized Unity's new movement system and the rigid body component to 
                create movement this time. The most significant difference is that 
                before, I  would have to manipulate vectors to create movement, but 
                with the rigid body, I would need to apply a force in the direction I 
                want the player to go. Then, the level was completed after adding some 
                logic to create the game loop.
